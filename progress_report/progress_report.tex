    \section{Changes}

    We have also changed the datasets used for our task. As mentioned in the 
    Edinburd paper (cite), the Hearthstone and Djanjo datasets, are not generalizable and
    would not be the right data to use for the task (Discussed more elaborately in Section
    X). As a result, we decided to scrape our own data from the repositories mentioned 
    in the Edinburd paper.

    \section{Project Plan}
    Due to the important task of gathering our own data for the task, the data creation and 
    processing phase of our original plan has taken up significant time, resulting in the
    following new plan.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Phase 1: \textit{Literature Survey} \hfill [\textbf{Done}]
        \item Phase 2: \textit{Data Preprocessing} \hfill [\textbf{In-progress}]
        \item Phase 3: \textit{Model training} \hfill [\textbf{Future work}]
    \end{enumerate}

    \section{Data}

      \subsection{Problems with existing datasets}
      The comments in the Django dataset are human annotated to explicitly describe what 
      the following line of code is. Because of this, the BLEU scores reported by the 
      research community on the Django dataset is high. However, this is not the case in general 
      production environment and the dataset is less useful for our task of converting natural 
      language comments to code. \\
      \hspace*{4mm}Marceli Barone et. al. (cite) also critiques about the django dataset on 
      similar lines. \\

      \hspace*{-4mm}Consider the following example from the Django dataset:
      \begin{lstlisting}[frame=single,basicstyle=\small]
comment:
  raise and exception InvalidCacheBackendError 
  with string "Could not find config for '\%s' 
  in settings.CACHES" as argument , replace ' 
  \%s ' with alias .

code:
  araise InvalidCacheBackendError ( "Could not 
  find config for '\%s' in settings.CACHES" \% 
  alias )

                  Example 1
      \end{lstlisting}

      As we can see, programmers are very unlikely to write such elaborate comments, 
      and learning from such input pairs, while making it feasible to achieve high 
      BLEU and accuracy scores, is not very useful for automatic code generation  
      in production environments

    \section{Methods}

    The two methods used:

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Base paper placeholder
        \item Vanilla seq2seq: To further illustrate the problems with HS and DJ data, we train a 
          vanilla seq2seq model in TensorFlow. Google separately provides a high-level API for 
          the same at google/seq2seq \cite{britz2017}, under the Apache 2.0 license. 
          We run the same model without modification. \\
          As TensorFlow provides the ability to see the training process via TensorBoard, we
          stopped model training when we saw no visible improvement on the dev corpus. The model
          trained was a BiDirectional LSTM model, with attention as described in 
          \cite{bahdanau2014neural}.
    \end{enumerate}

    \section{Experiments}

    DO you even experiment?

    \section{Results}

    End of humanity is near.

    \section{Future Word}
      Our current focus is on following two major tasks:
      \subsection{Adding context to data}
        We plan to add context to the data
      \subsection{Creation of dynamic top-down recursive networks}
        Not sure if we should do this.
